# nanoc

A toy C compiler that pretends to self compile.
The idea behind nanoc is to have a 100% pure C99 compiler that can self compile as a passing criteria. It should get there eventually.

## Status

Non functional. Just parser, lexer and it compiles to perform basic parser tests.

## Dependencies

It builds on Linux using gcc, bison and flex. It should work on Windows if you have those dependencies, but I haven't tested it.
